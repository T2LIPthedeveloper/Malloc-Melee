This will contain the engine built in C from scratch.

Engine for the text-based RPG would include the following features:
- A parser to interpret the player's input
- Player inventory
- Player stats
- Player location
- NPC interactions
- World interactions
- Combat system
- Saving and loading the game

Ideally we'd like to have multiple levels, each with a different theme and different enemies to fight. The player would have to navigate through the levels, fighting enemies and collecting items to progress. The combat system would be turn-based, with the player and enemies taking turns to attack each other.
